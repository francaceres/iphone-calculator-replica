          Hi! My name is Francisco Cáceres and I'm a junior front end developer
          from Córdoba, Argentina. I'm currently studying to be a full stack
          developer at Coderhouse and I've recently finished my courses on web
          development and Javascript. <br />
          Cheers!
        </p>

        <h3>...the replica</h3>
        <p>
          I began working on this replica as a way of practicing my recently
          acquired front end development skills. The technologies used here are
          HTML, CSS (including some SCSS) and vanilla JavaScript as they're the
          ones I've learned so far on my courses. <br />
          What surprised me the most about the challenge was to find out that
          coding a calculator isn't as simple as I thought it would be. I'm
          proud to have come up with a solution that is my own though, as I
          tried to figure it out by myself without looking for examples on the
          internet. Please do let me know if you find a better way to do it!
          <br />
          Finally, I'd like to clarify that there are still a few details that
          need to be solved on the calculator, like the functionality of the +/-
          and % buttons, and the overflow of the numbers of the display panels,
          which I will try to solve in time. <br />
          Anyway, thanks for checking out my project!
